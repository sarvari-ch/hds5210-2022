# Feedback on Final

Nice work on your final project. It demonstrated your skills well.

I like how you used a correlation heatmap to identify some key areas to explore in the data.

Some additional explanation of what you were doing along the way, maybe more than just a sentence fragment, would have been more helpful.  Still, your code and thought process was easy to follow.   (-2 from Documentation and Professionalism)

You used functions to create a bunch of different plots. I think that you probably could have written that as one function and then passed in the different columns, labels, etc as parameters. That would have been an appropriate use of functions.  (-5 from Modularity / Style)

Your conclusion could have used a little bit more "so what".  Is there a way to use this information in teh real world?  (-1 Problem Applicability)
