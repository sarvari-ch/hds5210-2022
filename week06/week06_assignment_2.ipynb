    "In order to submit your work, you'll need to use the `git` command line program to **add** your homework file (this file) to your local repository, **commit** your changes to your local repository, and then **push** those changes up to github.com.  From there, I'll be able to **pull** the changes down and do my grading.  I'll provide some feedback, **commit** and **push** my comments back to you.  Next week, I'll show you how to **pull** down my comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "First run through everything one last time and submit your work:\n",
    "1. Use the `Kernel` -> `Restart Kernel and Run All Cells` menu option to run everything from top to bottom and stop here.\n",
    "2. Then open a new command line by clicking the `+` icon above the file list and chosing `Terminal`\n",
    "3. At the command line in the new Terminal, follow these steps:\n",
    "  1. Change directories to your project folder and the week03 subfolder (`cd <folder name>`)\n",
    "  2. Make sure your project folders are up to date with github.com (`git pull`)\n",
    "  3. Add the homework files for this week (`git add <file name>`)\n",
    "  4. Commit your changes (`git commit -a -m \"message\"`)\n",
    "  5. Push your changes (`git push`)\n",
    "  \n",
    "If anything fails along the way with this submission part of the process, let me know.  I'll help you troubleshoort."
